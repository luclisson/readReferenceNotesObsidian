# readReferenceNotesPRV


this small python program was implemented to help my fellow tolino readers.
As a tolino reader myself I know that the lack of highlight sync support can be frustrating at times.
Therefore, I coded a small program which reads your references (if you connect your tolino to the pc there is a notes.txt file).
In oder to run the program you need to change the vars form the .sh file to your txt file's path and your output dir.
The Program automatically sorts by book and time.
Enjoy referencing :)

p.s. I dont know if the program works on all languages due to formatting. I just tested the german version.
     if there are any errors occurring just let me know and I fix it as soon as possible.
